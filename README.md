This project takes a home price data set and creates a price prediction model. The data is publicly 
available at [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/muhammadbinimran/housing-price-prediction-data)

The model is a multiple linear regression model built in Python.

The main program uses a simple CLI to get user input and output the price prediction. There is also a 
visualizations program to show basic visuals describing the data set.
